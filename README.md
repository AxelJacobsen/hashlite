# HashLite

## Initial idea
The plan is to construct a very rudamentary "roguelite" esq game. <br />
It will be mostly text based with a simple "visual" representation of the available choices. <br />
The goal would be to have a fully randomized map with; combat, character encounters (crude), loot rooms and a boss. <br />
<br />
Untill further notice to map will be balanced around a 10x10 size, though any size should be possible in the future.

## Changelogs
Might add merchants as alternate character encounter.


# Spoiler
<br /><br />
The bossfight is a refrence to the famous Norwegian gold-medalist Oddvar Br√•.<br />
I couldnt get myself to translate his frases as they simply arent funny in english.<br />
It was never intended for anyone to actually reach the bottom, and he exists more as an easteregg than and actual boss.<br />
