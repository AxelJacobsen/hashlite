# HashLite

## Initial idea
The plan is to make a very basic "roguelite" esq game. <br />
It will be mostly text based with a simple "visual" representation of the available choices. <br />
The goal would be to have a fully randomized map with; combat, character encounters (crude), loot rooms and a boss. <br />
<br />

## Missing features
Encounters: 
    Shop encounter
    People encounter
## Balancing
In the game things are designed to scale according to how far you have gotten, though i havent had the time to properly balance this. <br />
In other words, the start is usually gruelingly difficult, and at some point enemies die to one hit. <br />
This is simply the state of the game, since the intent isn't for players to actually play till floot 100.

# Spoiler
<br /><br />
The bossfight is a refrence to the famous Norwegian gold-medalist Oddvar Br√•.<br />
I couldnt get myself to translate his frases as they simply arent funny in english.<br />
It was never intended for anyone to actually reach the bottom, and he exists more as an easteregg than and actual boss.<br />
